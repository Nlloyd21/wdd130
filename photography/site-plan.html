        Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio and seeing some of my favorite works that I have completed. Here is a little about myself. I grew up mainly in Illinois for 17 years of my life. My senior year of high school, we moved to New Hampshire; one of the prettiest states I have ever seen. I have always loved photograpahy ever since I was little, but I have always wanted to learn more. So I decided to take a photography classmy senior year of high school. I was able to do some amazing projects in that class, and really experiment with photoshop, photography styles, colors, etc. 
        I am now studying at Brigham Young University-Idaho and have been continuing photography in my freetime.

      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        This is a portfolio of my work. The two images that are on this page so far are two of my favorite projects that I have ever completed. It was for our album cover project in my senior year photograpahy class. My teacher and other collegues were very impressed. The rest of the images that I will be posting on here will have a caption and a small description explaining a little about that image.

        For this page on my website, it will be a page for contact for anyone looking to book an appoitment to get their photos taken, or put in a request to have any photos edited. There will be a screen asking for their name, phone number and/or email, if they just want photos edited or photos taken, and the place of shooting for their session.
