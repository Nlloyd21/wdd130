                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio and seeing some of my favorite works that I have completed. Here is a little about myself. I was born and raised in Illinois for 17 years of my life. My senior year of high school, we moved to New Hampshire; one of the prettiest states I have ever seen. I have always loved photograpahy and videographyever since I was little. In 2018 I bought my first camera; a small Sony DSC-HX80. In 2020 during the pandemic, i decided to upgrade to a better camera; a Sony a6100. For my senior years of high school, I decided to take a photography class. I was able to do some amazing projects in that class, and really got to experiment and try new things with photoshop, photography styles, colors, etc. I am now studying at Brigham Young University-Idaho and have been continuing photography in my freetime.</p>
